# ROS Tutorials
This is the solution to ROS exercises used in ETH Zurich course   [`Programming for Robotics - ROS`](https://rsl.ethz.ch/education-students/lectures/ros.html).

This course gives an introduction to the Robot Operating System (ROS) including many of the available tools that are commonly used in robotics. With the help of different examples, the course should provide a good starting point for students to work with robots. They learn how to create software including simulation, to interface sensors and actuators, and to integrate control algorithms.
